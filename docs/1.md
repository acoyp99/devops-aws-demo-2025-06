This document tracks day-by-day progress, troubleshooting steps, discoveries, code and infrastructure changes during the PoC execution.

---

## 📅 Day 1 – 2025-06-10

### 🔍 Goal for Today
- [ ] Provision EC2 and configure VPC
  - [ ] Create a VPC with 2 public subnets.
  - [ ] Launch a t3.medium EC2 in a public subnet.
  - [ ] Create an S3 bucket for file storage.
  - [ ] Create a PostgreSQL RDS (free tier if possible).
  - [ ] Create a Route53 hosted zone (mock domain or use real one if available).
  - [ ] Output Terraform state and key resource outputs.

### ✅ What Was Done
- Terraform folder based on Modules coded. [terraform](../infra/chatbot/main.tf)
- 
- (Resources deployed or updated)

### 🐞 Troubleshooting Log
| Time | Issue | Attempted Fix | Outcome |
|------|-------|----------------|---------|
| HH:MM | Description of the issue | Actions taken | Result (fixed, partially fixed, unresolved) |

### 💡 Discoveries & Learnings
- (New CLI flags, unexpected behavior, default values, permissions required, etc.)

### 💾 Code Applied

#### 🤑 Infracosts

How to install Infracost and register for an API key?

Depending on your operating system, there are a couple of ways you can install Infracost.

To install Infracost on macOS, you can simply run:
```bash
  brew install infracost
  infracost –version

  infracost auth login
```
```log
We're redirecting you to our log in page, please complete that,
and return here to continue using Infracost.

If the redirect doesn't work, either:
- Use this URL:
    https://dashboard.infracost.io/login?cli_port=55706&cli_state=c421ee15-1ab4-413b-9751-87837fc8b4d2&cli_version=v0.10.41&os=darwin&utm_source=cli

- Or log in/sign up at https://dashboard.infracost.io, copy your API key
    from Org Settings and run `infracost configure set api_key MY_KEY`

Waiting...

The API key was saved to /Users/arley.coypaez/.config/infracost/credentials.yml

Your account has been authenticated. Run Infracost on your Terraform project by running:

  infracost breakdown --path=.
```


```bash
# Sample CLI or Terraform command
cd infra/chatbot
terraform init

terraform validate

terraform plan



terraform apply -auto-approve 
```
```hcl
# Sample IaC code block
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = "ami-xxxxxxxx"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
```

### ☁️ Cloud Infra Changes
- (New VPC, Subnets, EC2, Route53 Records, ELBs...)
- (Any deletions or manual overrides)

### 🔐 Auth & Security Notes
- (Changes to IAM roles, policies, SAML setups, SSL certs, secrets)

### 📌 Next Steps
- [ ] (What to complete tomorrow)
